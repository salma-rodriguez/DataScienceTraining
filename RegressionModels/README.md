A Motor Trend Study:
====================
Vehicle Transmission Effect on MPG
==================================

# Summary
In this report, we explore the relationship between miles per gallon (MPG) and
other characteristics for different car models, in order to determine whether
vehicles with automatic or manual transmission are more fuel efficient. We
quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmission and
provide the results of our findings. The analysis shows that although there is
greater MPG for vehicles with manual transmission, there are a few tradeoffs to
consider.
